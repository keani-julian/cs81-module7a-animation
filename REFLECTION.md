### REFLECTION

## What part of the code was most confusing and why?
The most confusing part of the code was understanding how setInterval continues running independently of the rest of the program. It helped to think of it as a scheduled task that the browser checks on between other work.

## How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
The animation makes asynchronous behavior visible by showing how the page continues to respond while updates happen over time. Nothing freezes, yet the state changes consistently.

## What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I improved the animation by changing how timing is controlled, which made it clearer that asynchronous loops can be shaped and adjusted rather than just started and stopped.
